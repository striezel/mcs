# Version history of Mouse Click Simulator

_(Note: This changelog focuses on the major changes between the different
versions. Therefore, it may not contain all changes. Especially smaller fixes or
improvements may be omitted.)_

## Version 0.?.? (2022-10-??)

* The list of available target windows is loaded during startup. That way the
  users do not have to explicitly refresh the list, if the target window is
  already there when the program starts.

## Version 0.2.1 (2022-09-18)

* The version information window does now show the revision from the Git version
  control system that was used to build the application, too.
* The version information window does now show some information about the .NET
  runtime, too.
* Some icons used in the application are replaced. More specifically, all icons
  from the Silk icon set are replaced with similar icons from the Fugue icon
  set. This way only one icon set is required to cover all needs.
* A proper icon is added to the setup and to the main windows of the
  application.

## Version 0.2.0 (2022-09-17)

* Icons are added to most buttons and menu entries.
* A separate form to show the application version and information about used
  third party components is added.
