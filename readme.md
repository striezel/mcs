## Prerequisites

To run the program you need the .NET 6 runtime.
The current .NET 6 runtime can be downloaded from
<https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime>.

Furthermore, the program only runs on Windows operating systems, because it uses
the Windows Application Programming Interface ("WinAPI") internally to send the
clicks to other application windows.

## Installation

To install the program, take a look at the
[available releases](https://github.com/striezel/mouse-click-simulator/releases)
and download the installer or ZIP file of the newest version from there.
